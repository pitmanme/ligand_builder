(1) ligand reshaping could be altered to allow difference methods such as 
	fexible: ligpose
	rigid: in ligand_reshaping
	

(2) make system_buider read an input file or flagged input arguments 

(3) it is possible the mtz_path in ligpose.py should be fed in as an optional argument. There might be cases where the structure referenced is too different from that on the PDB. 

(4) change it so you don't input openeye as an added argument. Too complicated and mostly runs with openeye currently anyways.

(5) automate the date_dir and pmx_ligands_dir so they aren't manually set. 

(6) with the current setup the different DUs in ligpose.py will be regenerated for each molecule looped through. Should probably rework this..
